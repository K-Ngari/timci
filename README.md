# TIMCI

TIMCI is a R package for managing and visualising in a Shiny app the data collected by ODK for the different studies of the TIMCI project (Tools for Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses).

## Installation of timci from GitHub:
You can copy the development version (`master` branch) of the `timci` package.

## Setup of the ODK Central connection:
You need to setup `ruODK` by creating environment variables in `~/.Renviron` for your project OData service URL and your ODK Central credentials (username and password):
```bash
ODKC_SVC="https://.../v1/projects/2/forms/....svc"
ODKC_UN=me@email.com
ODKC_PW=...
```
For more information about `ruODK`, there are lots of great resources available at [https://docs.ropensci.org/ruODK/](https://docs.ropensci.org/ruODK/)

## Usage

```R
library(timci)

timci::run_app() # Run Shiny app
```
